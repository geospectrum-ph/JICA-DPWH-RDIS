# Setup
1. In setting up the `Sequelize` and `mssql` => use connection strings instead of the default `Sequelize` object with arguments.
2. Before connecting to the database via the Node JS, the tables and user must already be created using the `sqlcmd`.
3. The use of the `sa` account is discouraged in connecting the nodejs app. Create another user, see the `infrastructure/setup_db.sh` on sample implementation.
