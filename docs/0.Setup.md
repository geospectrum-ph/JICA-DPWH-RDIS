# Setup
## Configuring Database
1. In setting up the `Sequelize` and `mssql` => use connection strings instead of the default `Sequelize` object with arguments.
2. Before connecting to the database via the Node JS, the tables and user must already be created using the `sqlcmd`.
3. The use of the `sa` account is discouraged in connecting the nodejs app. Create another user, see the `infrastructure/setup_db.sh` on sample implementation.

## Adding New Models
This assumes that you have `sequelize-cli` installed.
1. Create a model file under the `models`. Refer to the `models/user.js` as reference when creating your models. https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/
   - for the list of sequelize data types: https://sequelize.org/docs/v7/models/data-types/
2. In the `models/index.js`, add the newly created model file. Refer to the `db.users` examples.
3. Run the following sequelize-cli command: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`. This will create the necessary tables.
