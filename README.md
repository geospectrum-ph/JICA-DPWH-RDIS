## About the Project

The **SEEDs Rebuild** is a project created and maintained by **Geospectrum Analytics Services, Inc.** SEEDs (*Social-Economic-Environmental-Demographic Information Systems*) for Local Government Units (LGUs), or simply **SEEDs**, is a web portal and GIS application that provides local government units with a tool to effectively utilize the spatial and textual information about and within their
locality. It aims to provide LGUs with GIS-based functionalities that can help them in the:

1. *development and land use planning*,
2. *planning, monitoring, and implementing of local government projects*,
3. *formulation of economic plans and policies*,
4. *formulation of emergency, risk, and disaster mitigation plans and policies*,
5. *development of accurate master plans for health and safety, flood control, earthquakes, landslides, and relief distributions*,
6. *generation of local employment through hiring of local enumerators for the household survey*, and
7. *delivery of social services to its constituents through the development of a centralized database and realtime connectivity with the Local Civil Registry Office's (LCRO) records for the socio-economic profile*.

Built on a geospatial foundation, SEEDs provides LGUs with GIS-based mapping and data analysis systems that will enhance, among other things, the capability for the:

1. *planning, monitoring, and implementation of local government projects* (Social),
2. *formulation of economic development plans and land use policies* (Economic),
3. *development of master plans for health and safety, risk and disaster mitigation and other environmental policies* (Environmental), and
4. *efficient delivery of social services to its constituents with the aid of its demographic and socio-economic databases* (Demographic).

To enable this design philosophy, SEEDs is envisioned to be a geoportal where LGU can store various spatial and textual data from various sources. With this assumption, SEEDs provides a mechanism to upload and sort various data. A catalogue is provided with SEEDs to easily connect to its data repository and knowledge base. This populate and catalogue feature also provides the process for sorting and connecting the data to the SEEDs visualization system (profiles).
